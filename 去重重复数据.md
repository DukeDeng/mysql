### MySQL去除重复数据，保留一条
```
DELETE FROM 表名 WHERE (字段1,字段2,字段3)
IN 
(SELECT 字段1,字段2,字段3 FROM (SELECT 字段1,字段2,字段3 FROM 表名 GROUP BY 字段1,字段2,字段3 HAVING COUNT(*)>1) s1) 
AND
id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM (SELECT id FROM 表名 GROUP BY 字段1,字段2,字段3 HAVING COUNT(*)>1) s2);
```
---
#### 实际运用
```
DELETE FROM data_hash_amount WHERE (create_time,channel)
IN
(SELECT create_time,channel FROM (
                                 SELECT create_time,channel FROM data_hash_amount
where 1=1 GROUP BY create_time, channel HAVING COUNT(*)>1) s1)
AND
id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM (SELECT id FROM data_hash_amount where 1=1 GROUP BY create_time, channel HAVING COUNT(*)>1) s2);
```
